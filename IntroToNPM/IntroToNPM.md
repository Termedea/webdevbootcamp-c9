# Intro to npm

* Define NPM
    - Node Package Manager
    - Centralized place for 1000+ packages
* Why is it awesome?
    - From npmjs.com: "npm is the package manager for JavaScript"
    - From nodejs.org: "Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world."
* How does it work?
    - We can't add script tags on server side for libraries (packages)
    - We have to add them to server side code another way - using a package manager. 
* Intro to the packages we'll use
    - Express
    - Mongoose
    - EJS
    - CookieParser
    - Logger
    - BodyParser
    - ...

# Installing and using packages
