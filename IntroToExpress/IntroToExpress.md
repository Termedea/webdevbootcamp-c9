#Introduction to Express

* What is a framework, how is it different from a library?
    - Our definition of a library so far is "code that someone else wrote that we can use in our app", that is also true for frameworks
    - Usually a framework is bigger than a library an written by many
    - Stack overflow answers:
        - "When you call a library, you are in control. But with a framework, the control is inverted: the framework calls you."
        - "Basically, all the control flow is already in the framework, and there's just a bunch of predefined white spots that you can fill out with your code."
        - "A library on the other hand is a collection of functionality that you can call."
            - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3057526/framework-vs-toolkit-vs-library
    - With a library we can choose to call one or many functions of the library, but with a framework we give up some of the control to do things the way
      the framework intends us to. The framework gives us a basic scaffolding for us to fill in the blanks.
    - We don't have to do the groundwork every single time, we get started more quickly. 
* What is Express?
    - Web development framewok
    - From expressjs.com: Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.
* Why are we using Express?
    - It's the most popular web developer node framework = big community, lots of tutorials
    - It's lightweight (you're expected to fill in more yourself), it doesn't hide things, it doesn't do things you don't expect it to do. 
    - Rails (and .net), for example, does a lot in the behind that is difficult to understand.
    - You need to understand the basics and why you are doing stuff. You don't get stuff magically for free with Express.
