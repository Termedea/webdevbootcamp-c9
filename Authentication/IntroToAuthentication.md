## Intro to Auth
* What tools are we using?
    * Passport -  http://passportjs.org/
    * Passport Local - https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport-local (for username and password)
    * Passport Local Mongoose - https://github.com/saintedlama/passport-local-mongoose
    * Express sessions
* Why using tools?
    *  Is it about understanding conceptually or is it about making stuff fast?
    *  Focus is making authentication work with the deep dive at the end.
