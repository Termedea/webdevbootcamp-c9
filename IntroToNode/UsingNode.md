#Using Node

* Interact with the Node-console (type "node")
    - Javascript console, similar to the javascript console in browser, but for *serverside* javascript. 
    - Can't write bash commands in here. 
    - It's called a REPL (read, evaluate, print, loop)
    - Alert, document and other DOM (selectors, events, manipulators) comes with the *browser*, is not supported in REPL.
* Run a file with node (type "node <filename>.js")
    - create a javascript file and execute it through node command.
